## 1. Introduction to Concurrency and Parallelism

- **Concurrency**: The ability of a program to deal with multiple tasks at once.
- **Parallelism**: The ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, utilizing multiple CPU cores.

**Key Concepts**:

- **Processes**: Independent execution units with their own memory space.
- **Threads**: Lighter units of execution within a process, sharing the same memory space.

---

## 2. Threads in Operating Systems

### 2.1 OS Threads vs. Python Threads

**OS Threads**:

- Managed by the operating system's kernel.
- Can run in parallel on multi-core processors.
- Provide true parallelism for both IO-bound and CPU-bound tasks.

**Python Threads**:

- Implemented using OS threads in the `threading` module.
- In CPython, they map directly to native threads.
- Subject to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which can limit parallel execution.

### 2.2 Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

- **Definition**: A mutex (manager-prevents-parallel-variable-access) that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies memory management in CPython.
- **Impact**:
    - Limits parallelism in CPU-bound Python code.
    - Less of an issue for IO-bound tasks, as threads often wait on IO operations.

---

## 3. Threading in Python

### 3.1 Creating and Managing Threads

**Creating Threads**:

```python
import threading

def worker():
    print("Worker thread is running")

    thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)
    thread.start()
    thread.join()  # Wait for the thread to finish
```

**Thread Lifecycle**:

- **Start**: `thread.start()`
- **Run**: Executes the target function.
- **Join**: `thread.join()` waits for the thread to complete.

### 3.2 Synchronization Primitives

- **Lock (`threading.Lock`)**:
    - Ensures mutual exclusion.
    - Use `lock.acquire()` and `lock.release()`, or use as a context manager.

**Example**:

```python
import threading

lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_function():
    with lock:
        # Critical section
        pass
```

### 3.3 Best Practices with Threads

- **Avoid Shared State**:
    - Minimize the use of shared data to reduce synchronization complexity.

- **Use Thread Pools**:
    - Utilize `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for managing threads.

- **Limit the Number of Threads**:
    - Excessive threads can lead to overhead from context switching.

- **Ensure Thread Safety**:
    - Always protect shared mutable data with locks or other synchronization mechanisms.

---

## 4. Choosing the Optimal Number of Threads

### 4.1 Factors to Consider

1. **Nature of Tasks**:
    - **IO-bound**: Can benefit from more threads than CPU cores.
    - **CPU-bound**: Limited by the GIL in CPython; threads may not improve performance.

2. **System Resources**:
    - Number of CPU cores.
    - Available memory.

3. **Performance Overhead**:
    - Context switching.
    - Memory consumption per thread.

4. **Application Requirements**:
    - Desired throughput and latency.

### 4.2 Guidelines for Python Applications

- **For IO-bound Applications**:
    - Start with a number of threads equal to or greater than the number of CPU cores.
    - Use benchmarking to determine optimal thread count.

- **For CPU-bound Applications**:
    - Use multiprocessing (`multiprocessing` module) to bypass the GIL.
    - Consider using native extensions or optimizing code.

- **Using Thread Pools**:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def task(arg):
    # Perform some IO-bound operation
    pass

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(task, arg) for arg in args]
    results = [future.result() for future in futures]
```

## 5. Asynchronous Programming with Asyncio

### 5.1 Event Loop and Coroutines

- **Event Loop**:
    - Core of `asyncio`, managing the execution of asynchronous tasks.

- **Coroutines**:
    - Declared with `async def`.
    - Use `await` to pause execution and yield control back to the event loop.

**Example 1**:

```python
import asyncio


async def main():
    print('Hello')
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('World')


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Example 2**
```python
import time

# Define a coroutine using a generator
def coroutine_1():
    for i in range(3):
        print(f'Coroutine 1: {i}')
        yield  # Pause execution

def coroutine_2():
    for i in range(3):
        print(f'Coroutine 2: {i}')
        yield  # Pause execution

# Simple event loop
def run_coroutines(coroutines):
    coroutines = list(coroutines)
    while coroutines:
        for coro in coroutines:
            try:
                next(coro)
                time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate waiting for IO
            except StopIteration:
                coroutines.remove(coro)

# Run the coroutines
run_coroutines([coroutine_1(), coroutine_2()])
```


### 5.2 Asyncio vs. Threading

- **Asyncio**:
    - Single-threaded cooperative multitasking.
    - Suitable for high-concurrency IO-bound applications.
    - Lower overhead compared to threading.

- **Threading**:
    - Preemptive multitasking managed by the OS.
    - Can leverage multiple CPU cores for IO-bound tasks.
    - Overhead from context switching and potential complexity in synchronization.

---

## 6. Inter-Thread Communication

### 6.1 Queues and Blocking Operations

- **Queue (`queue.Queue`)**:
    - Thread-safe FIFO queue.
    - Used for communication between threads.

**Blocking Operations**:

- **`put(item)`**: Blocks if the queue is full.
- **`get()`**: Blocks if the queue is empty.

**Example**:

```python
import queue

q = queue.Queue()

# Producer
q.put(item)

# Consumer
item = q.get()
q.task_done()

# Wait until all items are processed
q.join()
```

### 6.2 Locks and Race Conditions

- **Race Conditions**:
    - Occur when multiple threads access and modify shared data concurrently.

- **Using Locks to Prevent Race Conditions**:

```python
import threading
import time

counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment_counter():
    global counter
    for _ in range(1000):
        with lock:  # you can remove this to check race conditions
            counter += 1
            time.sleep(0.0001)

threads = []
for _ in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=increment_counter)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()

print(f"Final counter value: {counter}")
```

## 7. Thread Scheduling and the OS Scheduler

- **OS Scheduler**:
    - Part of the operating system kernel.
    - Manages the execution of threads and processes.
    - Decides which thread runs on which CPU core and for how long.

- **Thread Management**:

    - **No Extra Thread for Scheduling**:
        - Scheduling is handled by the OS, not by a separate thread in your application.

    - **In Python**:
        - The interpreter and the GIL manage the execution of threads at the bytecode level.
        - Context switching between threads occurs when the GIL is released and acquired.
